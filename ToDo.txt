Current fixes to be done for the NEoA Modpack

Mekanism armor is craftable, should be like the other metal armors.
- Remove Osmium, glowstone, etc armors. leave obsidian? or make harder...
Dirt crafts into: earthworks and better with mods conflicts
- if better with mods has an api, make it millable, otherwise edit earthworks recpie.
Salt issues, water buckets get used with pams? and mekanism salt is hard to find.
