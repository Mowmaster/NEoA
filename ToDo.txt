Current fixes to be done for the NEoA Modpack

Mekanism armor is craftable, should be like the other metal armors.
- Remove Osmium, glowstone, etc armors. leave obsidian? or make harder...
++ Possibly not removed, per mystic

Salt issues, water buckets get used with pams? and mekanism salt is hard to find.
- fix pams recipies
++ Check salt recipie in pack, works fine with both pams and mekanism loaded in dev.
